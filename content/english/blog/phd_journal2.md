I caught viral fever and missed 1 class from each of the courses. I completed and submitted Assignment 1 from Cloud Computing course. I have almost completed the Assignment 1 from parallel programming. The parallel assignment is little bit tricky but I have figured it out. Also made good progress in understanding the PHD project. The existing work is massive, and my goal is to understand every corner of it.
