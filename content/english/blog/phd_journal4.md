I recently experienced another bout of illness that kept me incapacitated for an entire week. However, after recovering, I managed to accomplish several tasks. I successfully completed another cloud assignment and made significant progress on a parallel assignment, although it's not entirely finished. Additionally, I took my mid-semester exam, with a good performance in the cloud subject but a disappointing result in the parallel one.

On the academic front, I also advanced my PhD project. I now possess a relatively solid grasp of the current system, and I am beginning to develop a clearer outline of the direction my PhD research will take.
