This week has been relatively calm, and I was able to focus mainly on self study. The week before that was quite hectic. The parallel course is not going well for me, I didn't get good marks in Minor, but I thought I would do well in the assignments. But due to some edge cases, my submission failed some testcases. So I am currently stressed because of that. I need to do better.
