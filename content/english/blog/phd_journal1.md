I have enrolled in two courses, "Parallel Programming" and "Cloud Computing". The cloud course is taught by my PHD advisor Prof. Abhilash Jindal. Parallel Programming is taught by Prof. Subodh. So far both classes have been quite interesting. We also had a project meeting. Mostly it was introduction of other project members.
