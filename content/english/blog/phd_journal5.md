I am currently juggling multiple academic commitments. My primary focus is on my Ph.D. project. In addition to this, I have successfully finished an assignment on parallel computing using OpenMPI and another assignment in the cloud computing course. However, I am facing the pressure of three impending deadlines. The first deadline is for my Ph.D. project, which is almost finalized. The second is for a Cloud Course Project, which I have yet to start. The third deadline pertains to another parallel computing assignment, which is approximately 50% complete. Additionally, I am in the process of learning CUDA.
