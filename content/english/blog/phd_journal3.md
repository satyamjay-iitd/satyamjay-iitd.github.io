This week I was able to complete a hard assignment in Parallel Programming Course(Skill Issue). Also completed a Cloud Computing assignment which was relatively easy. I also cleared a major roadblock in PHD project. Went to lunch with another PHD student who was visiting IITD for a talk. Great talk, inspired me to improve my own Presentation Skill.
