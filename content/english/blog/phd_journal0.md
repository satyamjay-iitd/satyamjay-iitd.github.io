When the thought of doing a Phd first came to my mind, I was immediately surprised by how little information/guidance was available for aspiring students. I wished I could find a diary of a Phd students mentioning his struggle and achievements as he/she moved through the program. Then and there I decided, if I join a Phd program I will write weekly journal desribing my journey. I understand that unlike undergrad program, the experience of a Phd student varies based on his/her subject, guide, and most of all him/herself. However I believe that the journal will provide some rough idea of whats to come, if someone decides to walk this path.

## Tentative publishing schedule

I will write the journal weekly. And at the end of every semester I will ask ChatGPT to summarize and publish that summary as well.
